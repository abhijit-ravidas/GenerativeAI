Built my first Streamlit Chatbot App 🤖 using Python + Streamlit for interactive PDF-based Q&A. 
Users can upload PDFs, ask dynamic questions via the sidebar, and get contextual answers in real time. 
This prototype showcases the foundation of a retrieval-augmented chatbot (RAG) — combining simplicity, interactivity, and the power of Generative AI.
